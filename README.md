# SF-Mono-Nerd-Font
SF-Mono-Font with complete nerd font patch, no ligature.

# Usage 
**macos**
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/humbornjo/SF-Mono-Nerd-Font
cd SF-Mono-Nerd-Font && cp ./SF* $USER/Library/Fonts/
```
Add font family as "SFMono Nerd Font".

# Tips
Some glyphs are wierd, like `f0142` in [nerd font glyphs](https://www.nerdfonts.com/cheat-sheet), which is supposed to be chubby, but now a small dwarf =n=.
But filetype icons are all fine for now.

# Warning 
Be using alacritty, an anti-ligature emulator. So bye bye Ligature. But you can patch your own using [Ligaturizer](https://github.com/ToxicFrog/Ligaturizer).
